COM_FCADMIN_NO_AVAILABILITY_CRON_EMAIL="Dear %s,\n\nThis is a courtesy email to advise that you have one or more property calendar set to ‘unavailable’ or ‘booked’.\n\nWithout availability set, this unit will not be returned in a date search by a holiday maker.\n\nWe would urge you to go to www.frenchconnections.co.uk to check your page and update accordingly via the Owners Area.\n\nThe rolling calendar shows 19 months from current date. As the current month passes a new month will display at the end of your page and this will need availability setting if you wish to reach a potential enquirer for this month. You may also wish to take advantage of the free SMS service to receive an alert on your mobile phone each time an enquiry comes in.\n\nThis alert to check your page, is part of the service we provide in a bid to ensure you maximize all opportunities to achieve enquiries and bookings for your property.  If you have chosen to set your calendar as unavailable and it is not an oversight, then we apologise for troubling you.\n\nKind regards,\n\nFrench Connections Team"
