COM_USERPORT_HELP_ABOUT_1="<p>With <strong>userport</strong>, you can easily view, add, update or delete a lot of users at once while working with CSV text strings. <br/><strong><big>v3.0 beta 3 for Joomla! 1.6, 1.7 &amp; 2.5</big></strong></p>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_ABOUT_2="<p>Each task (adding users, updating users, deleting users or exporting them) takes only a few steps to complete. There exist quite some configuration settings at your disposal at each step: take your time to become familiar with them, so you can use them fully. The text here and on each page for each step will help you in understanding the process, as will the lengthy tooltips for each option. Be sure to test first thoroughly, especially when the email functionality has been activated. <strong>userport</strong> has a special <em>test mode</em> so you can verify the implications of each task, and the contents of each email that might otherwise get sent to all your affected users. Use it: <strong>userport</strong> is a powerful tool.</p>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_ABOUT_3="<p><strong>userport</strong> uses the Joomla platform calls as much as possible. Due to this, plugins that are designed to do <em>something</em> each time a user gets added, updated or deleted, will get run after <strong>userport</strong> made changes in the database. Technically: all <code>User</code> plugins that contain the <code>onUserBeforeSave</code>, <code>onUserAfterSave</code>, <code>onUserBeforeDelete</code> or <code>onUserAfterDelete</code> functions will have a chance to react on the user change. This is an intended feature: whenever a user gets deleted, you'll want its session information purged as well. And when a user gets added, you may want to create a connection in the CB tables. This is accomplished due to this design. Also other features can easily be extended by installing additional plugins. Examples are %s - all these were found after only a quick search on the %s.<br />Unintended behavior may arise whenever one of those plugins does something you don't want it to, but lacks the flexibility to disable the specific behavior. A concrete example is the default <code>User Joomla</code> plugin, that sends out emails each time a user gets added. For this specific plugin, the sending of emails is unfortunately hard coded - on Joomla platforms before v2.5 Beta 2 - and can not be changed without changing its PHP code. Since this is undesired behaviour for most users, <strong>userport</strong> will warn you whenever it detects this situation.<br/><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>User</code> plugins will not get triggered when using the <em>test mode</em>.</p>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_ABOUT_4="<p><em>In case of problems, help yourself, help me and help other site administrators by <a href='%s'>reporting them</a>! Add your comments or create a new ticket at <a href='%s'><strong>userport</strong>&acute;s site</a>.</em></p>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_CLOSURE="<p>Hopefully, this component is of any use for you. Do feel free to <a href='%s'>add a bug report</a> or to <a href='%s'>request functionality</a>. Everybody&acute;s time is limited, but most likely you won&acute;t get what you don&acute;t ask for.<br/>And if you want to show your appreciation even more, you can consider to <a href='%s'>make a donation</a>. Any gift is gratefully accepted: the idea someone values this extension high enough to actually <em>give money</em> is extremely motivating.</p>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_DRY_RUN="When the test mode is enabled, no modifications to the database will be made, and no user will receive any email. Since the logic is still executed as much as possible, this allows you to safely try out different settings and CSV import texts and see what the effect would be. If you fill in an email address below, all emails that would normally be sent to each user are still prepared, but only sent when <code>Notify user</code> is chosen, and then <em>to this given address only.</em> This allows you to test whether your webhost provider allows you to send out this many emails, and to check the email contents as they would be received by each user."
;COM_USERPORT_HELP_EDIT
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EDIT_1="<strong>Format</strong><li><strong>userport</strong> is pretty liberal in the required format of the CSV text below: although it requires that the first line is a header, the order in which the field names are given may be chosen arbitrarily. Also, most fields do not need to be given: a value can be generated or a sensible default can be selected when a field is absent.</li><li><strong>userport</strong> also automatically detects the field separator and field enclosure used. You may use a comma <code>,</code> or a semi colon <code>;</code> or a tab <code> </code> or a dollar sign <code>$</code> or an ampersand <code>&amp;</code> to separate your fields; you may use a single quote <code>'</code> or a double quote <code>&quot;</code> to mark the start and the end of your field values. <em>The detection is based on the first line</em> and is assumed to remain the same for all lines in your import text. When a field is enclosed (with e.g. a double quote <code>&quot;</code>), you must escape that character should it exist in your field's value (e.g. a double quote <code>&quot;</code> then becomes <code>&quot;&quot;</code>). Especially when the <strong><code>params</code></strong> field is present, using the single quote <code>'</code> as field enclosure character is recommended for legibility. Also, only those fields which contain the field separator must be enclosed with the field enclosure character; of course, a csv import text in which all fields are enclosed and all special characters are escaped is accepted too.<br/>Parsing will always happen on a line per line basis, so you must avoid line breaks in your values.</li>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EDIT_2="<strong>Fields</strong><li>The recognized header fields are: <strong><code>%s</code></strong>. Headers that are not recognized will be skipped.<br/>The only required header field for an <code>Add</code> operation is <strong><code>email</code></strong> - Joomla! requires a unique email address for each user. Either or both <strong><code>name</code></strong> and <strong><code>username</code></strong> may be omitted: if <strong><code>username</code></strong> is not present, the value for <strong><code>name</code></strong> or <strong><code>email</code></strong> will be used; if <strong><code>name</code></strong> is not present, the value for <strong><code>username</code></strong> or <strong><code>email</code></strong> will be used. The other operations - <code>Update</code> and <code>Delete</code> - only require that at minimum <strong><code>username</code></strong> is present: this is used to check for an existing user in the database.</li><li>When updating users, only the changed fields need to be added, but if you do provide the same value for a field, <strong>userport</strong> will ignore that value. <strong>userport</strong> can also detect whether a plain text password in the import text matches the encrypted password in the database. Only real changes cause database modifications and trigger the sending of emails.</li>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EDIT_3="<strong>Restriction</strong><li>All operations are restricted by the list of allowed groups: the list of groups you are part of (not applied for a super user) <strong>and</strong> that have front-end access only. Even if you are a super user, you can only add, edit or delete users who can not login in the back-end. For you, the allowed list of groups is <strong><code>%s</code></strong>. Users can only be added to these groups, and users part of a group not listed can not be updated or deleted using <strong>userport</strong>. <strong>userport</strong> will discard disallowed groups should they be listed in the import text, and also block any update to users outside these groups - you will receive proper warning messages when this happens.</li>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EDIT_4="<strong>Multiple values</strong><li>When adding or updating, you can indicate different user groups per user. Use the vertical bar <code>|</code> to combine multiple groups: that user will be added to each given group.</li><li>The <strong><code>params</code></strong> field may be formatted as JSON (as used in Joomla! 1.6, 1.7 and 2.5), as XML, or in INI format (as used in Joomla! 1.5). The format chosen may vary per user. To avoid line breaks in the INI format, you must use the vertical bar <code>|</code> instead to separate each parameter.</li>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EDIT_5="When you have finished editing the import text, you can choose the operation to perform by clicking to corresponding button above. You will then have a chance to set some options specific for the chosen operation. There you can a.o. choose to ignore some fields, set default values if a field is absent, choose to use an override value instead of the value listed in the import text, and choose whether to merge or to replace a value (when updating)."
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EMAIL_1="An email is only sent when <code>Notify User</code> is set to <code>yes</code> <strong>and</strong> both the email subject and body is not empty."
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EMAIL_2="When in test mode, all recipients are replaced with the <code>Email address to redirect to</code>."
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EMAIL_3="When not in test mode, the email addresses <strong>%s</strong> are placed in the <code>bcc</code> field and will receive a blind copy of all emails sent."
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EMAIL_4="Emails are sent according to your Joomla! configuration. To check, go to <code>Site &gt; <a href='index.php?option=com_config'>Global Configuration</a> &gt; Server &gt; Mail Settings.</code> Many webhost providers severely limit the number of emails you can send in a short time when not using the <code>SMTP Server</code> as <code>Mailer</code>, in an attempt to fend of spammers. For more information about how to configure your <code>Mail Settings</code>, check with your webhost provider."
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EMAIL_5="The email subject and body template may contain any number of tags, which will get replaced before sending out each individual email.<br/>The recognized tags are listed below."
COM_USERPORT_HELP_EMAIL_6="<dl><dt><strong>{user_name}</strong></dt><dd>The user&acute;s name. Generally his real name; this is not used to login with.</dd><dt><strong>{user_email}</strong></dt><dd>The user&acute;s email address. The <code>To:</code> field will contain this value if the test mode is disabled.</dd><dt><strong>{user_login}</strong></dt><dd>The user&acute;s nickname which he must use to login with.</dd><dt><strong>{user_password}</strong></dt><dd>The user&acute;s plaintext password when the user has been added. When passwords are automatically generated, the only way one can know the password is when he has received an email with this tag; if the email doesn&acute;t arrive or is not sent, the user must use the Joomla! built-in feature to reset the password.<br/><em>Once stored in the database, it is impossible to convert it back to the plainttext password. Also, when adding or updating with an encrypted password, the plaintext password is not known. In these cases, a series of stars will be used instead.</em></dd><dt><strong>{user_groups}</strong></dt><dd>The assigned list of groups, separated by a comma. This determines his rights on your site. Only groups without access to the back-end can be set, and only users not part of groups with back-end access can be modified or deleted. The groups without back-end access are: <strong>%s</strong></dd><dt><strong>{user_log}</strong></dt><dd>The log lists all the changes that are made to the user&acute;s settings.</dd><dt><strong>{activation_url}</strong></dt><dd>The url that the user must click upon to prove the email address is valid and in use. Clicking the link will unblock the account and the user is then able to login. Will be equal to <code>{site_url}</code> when no activation string has been set. Note that the url will give a <code>403 Access Forbidden</code> error when <code>New User Account Activation</code> is disabled. You can check and change this setting in the <code>Options</code> of the <code><a href='index.php?option=com_users'>User Manager</a></code>.<br/>Current value: <strong>%sabc</strong> where abc will be replaced with the random activation string. <br/><em>If explicitly given in the import text, ensure the uniqueness of the activation string. This is not checked for.<br/>Also, the activation string must have a length of 32 characters - all other lengths are not accepted. This is checked for.</em></dd><br/><dt><strong>{site_name}</strong></dt><dd>The name of the site as set in <code>Site &gt; <a href='index.php?option=com_config'>Global Configuration</a> &gt; Site &gt; Site Settings.</code><br/>Current value: <strong>%s</strong></dd><dt><strong>{site_url}</strong></dt><dd>The URL of the frontpage of your site.<br/>Current value: <strong>%s</strong></dd><br/><dt><strong>{admin_name}</strong></dt><dd>The value of <code>From Name</code> as set in <code>Site &gt; <a href='index.php?option=com_config'>Global Configuration</a> &gt; Server &gt; Mail Settings</code>.<br/>Current value: <strong>%s</strong></dd><dt><strong>{admin_email}</strong></dt><dd>The value of <code>From Email</code> as set in <code>Site &gt; <a href='index.php?option=com_config'>Global Configuration</a> &gt; Server &gt; Mail Settings</code>.<br/>Current value: <strong>%s</strong></dd></dl>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_TASK_OVERVIEW_ADD="<dt><strong>add</strong></dt><dd>Click on <code>%s</code> to make changes to the user database list. You&acute;ll likely want to start with either an empty CSV string or with a file you prepared locally. After making your selection you can still make further additions or modifications when you click <code>%s</code>.<br>Do read the helpful explanations above and below the text area: a lot of fields do not need to be given, as sensible defaults can be used, or an override value can be given in the next step. Once you are happy with the input, click <code>%s</code>.<br />You then have a chance to set some options, configure whether emails get sent - and how they will look like - and select the test mode. The options allow you to override some of the fields that may or may not be present in the CSV text. For example, if for some or all users a list of groups is given, but you want to add all users as <code>Editor</code> regardless the given value, you can easily do so.<br />Finally click <code>%s</code> again to let <strong>userport</strong> work on your CSV text: it will be parsed and modifications made are presented in a final result log.</dd>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_TASK_OVERVIEW_BEGIN="<h4>There are four different actions you can perform using <strong>userport</strong>:</h4><dl>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_TASK_OVERVIEW_DELETE="<dt><strong>delete</strong></dt><dd>Irreversibly deleting users can be done via <code>%s</code> as well. Follow the same path and finally click <code>%s</code>.<br/><em>Just like when updating, the safety measures protect users with back-end privileges from mass destruction.</em></dd>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_TASK_OVERVIEW_END="<br/><p>Using <strong>userport</strong>, it is very easy to migrate all users from your 1.5 site to 1.6 or 1.7. Simply install the latest <code>2.x</code> version on your old site, and the latest <code>3.x</code> version on your new site. Then export all your users on your old site, and use that as import text to add your users on your new site. <strong>userport</strong> will take care of everything, except for creating missing user groups: all the user fields will be copied or converted where necessary, but a usertype on your old site that no longer exists as a user group on your new site will be converted to a default group. Create the necessary user groups beforehand using the <code><a href='index.php?option=com_users&view=groups'>User Manager</a></code>.</p><p><strong>userport</strong> takes care that scripts don&acute;t time out on the server: when needed, the processing is split up in blocks, and you have a chance to review the results of the finished block before continuing with the next block.</p><p><strong>userport</strong> also has a test mode: use it! Warnings and errors (e.g. parsing problems, invalid email addresses, ...) will be reported and you will likely want to review and correct them before making real changes. Before making a lot of modifications to your user tables, the test mode is a handy way to verify the correct parsing of the CSV text and the format of the emails.<br/><strong>Be cautious when updating or deleting a lot of users at once: be responsible, and ensure you can restore all of your user information at any time.</strong> Before making major changes, I recommend you export the full user list - using <strong>userport</strong> of course.</p>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_TASK_OVERVIEW_UPDATE="<dt><strong>update</strong></dt><dd>Click on <code>%s</code> again. This time, you may want to start with the existing users. Make that choice, click <code>%s</code> and make your modifications. When updating, only those fields that you want changed need to be given; but if you do provide the same value, <strong>userport</strong> will detect this and ignore the non-change: only real changes will cause a database change (thereby triggering the <code>User</code> plugins).<br>Once you are happy with the input, click <code>%s</code> to set the options used for updating. Finally click <code>%s</code> again to let <strong>userport</strong> do its job.<br/><em>Quickly blocking all front-end users at once just takes a few clicks of effort. You can simply follow the path outlined here; make no modifications to the CSV text and select the option to override the blocked and activation value. Unblocking, setting or clearing an activation string or changing the assigned groups is done in an equally simple way.<br/>Note that it is impossible to make any modification to any user that has back-end access. This is a safety precaution built-in in <strong>userport</strong>.</em></dd>"
COM_USERPORT_HELP_TASK_OVERVIEW_VIEW="<dt><strong>view</strong></dt><dd>Click on <code>%s</code> to view the current users in the database. This is a quick and easy way to get a full listing of all your users which you can save in a text file and can use to populate a new Joomla! website with.</dd>"

This is an intended feature, but unintended behavior may arise whenever one of those plugins does something you don't want it to, but lacks the flexibility to disable the specific behavior. A concrete example is the default <code>User Joomla</code> plugin, that sends out emails each time a user gets added. For this specific plugin, sending of emails is unfortunately hard coded - on Joomla platforms before v2.5 Beta 2 - and can not be changed without changing its PHP code.<br/><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>User</code> plugins will not get triggered when the <em>test mode</em> is enabled.</p>"

; displayed as plain text: any markup is not rendered.

COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_INITIAL_TEXT="Choose here what you want to use as initial text. Depending on your selection here the other settings will be used or not. In the next step the text is loaded and displayed, and you'll have a chance to make further edits before continuing."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_FILE="Choose here the file that contains the import text you want to work with. The file selected here will be uploaded, read and displayed in the next step, if option B is selected as initial text."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_FIELD_SEPARATOR="Choose here the field separator userport should use to create the header and the user list."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_FIELD_ENCLOSURE="Choose here the field enclosure userport should use to create the header and the user list. Only when a field value contains a special character, the field will be enclosed and the special characters escaped. It is recommended to use the single quote, especially when dealing with the params field in JSON format."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_EXPORT_WHICH_FIELDS="The selection made here determines which fields will be exported. The basic user fields only exports those fields that are most commonly used when manipulating users; you can also choose to export all fields userport understands and can use; and also simply all fields. The last option is useful if you added fields to the user table sctructure, or if you must have the specific internal row id for each user."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_EXPORT_FILTER="If you export your current users, only those users you are allowed to update or delete are displayed. Here you can further restrict the list of users that may be retained."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_EXPORT_GROUPS_FILTER="Restrict the number of users fetched from the database by selecting one or more groups. Only users who have been explicitly assigned to at least one of these groups will be retained. Users who only inherit the group rights are excluded. Select all groups or make no selection to not filter on groups." 
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_ADD_OPTION_AUTO_GENERATE_PASSWORDS="Choose here if userport must create a random password if a password is not provided. The randomly generated password will be displayed in the overview log after completing the add operation."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_OPTION_GROUPS_HANDLING_ORIGIN="Choose here if userport must ignore all information about groups listed in the import text, and use the selected override value instead. Selecting to use the override value saves you the hassle from adding the same value to each user in your import text."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_OPTION_BLOCK_ACTIVATE_HANDLING_ORIGIN="Choose here if userport must ignore all information about blocked status and activation string in the import text, and use the selected override value instead. Selecting to use the override value saves you the hassle from adding the same value to each user in your import text."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_OPTION_PASSWORD_HANDLING_ORIGIN="Choose here if userport must ignore all passwords listed in the import text, and use the selected override value instead. Selecting to use the override value saves you the hassle from adding the same value to each user in your import text. When usign the import text, you can also choose what to use when no password has been found for a user: generate a new random password each time, or re-use the same override value."

Selecting No saves you the hassle from manually removing them in the import text; you can also choose to retain all current assignments and only add those groups that a user not yet belongs too; or you can retain the default value, which is to remove all current assignments before adding new ones."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_UPDATE_OPTION_BLOCK_ACTIVATE_HANDLING="Choose here if the blocked and/or the activation status may be updated. These two properties are treated together because there is a dependency between each other: a user which is not yet activated must also be blocked. Selecting No saves you the hassle from manually removing them in the import text."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_UPDATE_OPTION_PARAMS_HANDLING="Choose here if the parameter list may be updated. Selecting No saves you the hassle from manually removing them in the import text; you can also choose to retain all current parameters and merge them with the new ones, whereby the new values overwrite the possibly existing values; or you can choose to remove all current values first before adding the new parameter list."

When adding users, this value will be used when the field is missing or invalid in the import text; when adding or updating users, this value will be used if the option to use the override value is chosen. The value may be given as JSON (as used in Joomla! 1.6 and 1.7), as XML, or as INI format (as used in Joomla! 1.5) with one extra condition: line breaks are not allowed. For parameters formatted in the INI format you must use the vertical bar | instead."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_OPTION_DRY_RUN="Be careful! If you disable the test mode, changes will be made to the database, and mails are possible sent to each affected user. Userport has no undo functionality, and obviously cannot revoke any mail sent. "
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_OPTION_DRY_RUN_EMAIL="Enter here an email address where all generated mails must be diverted to. This field is only used if the test mode is still enabled, and if you chose to notify the affected users - see below."
COM_USERPORT_DESCRIPTION_OPTION_NOTIFY_USER="Choose here whether each affected user should be notified by mail. When changing passwords, sending an email is often the only way to inform the user of his new password: userport nor Joomla! store the plain text password."
